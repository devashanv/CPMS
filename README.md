# Corona Pandemic Management System - CPMS 🚀

The “Corona Pandemic management system (CPMS)” is a solution for collect data, store data, 
and manage all data and make a decision with information created by for MOH Officers and 
PHI officers. And it is a standalone system that allows to take functionalities for improved 
management and transparency of data. 

## ⫼ Overview 

Corona pandemic started in 2019. In a very short time, it spread all over the world. Sri Lanka 
also spread rapidly with the first patient being reported. The entire country had to be shut 
down. On this situation a lot of sacrifice and risky work was done from the health sector. A 
major challenge for them was the lack of proper maintenance of patient records and difficulty 
in managing the data properly. 

Based on that reason, I wanted to create a solution. I decided to create a suitable system to 
get the data they face properly and manage it properly. 

This system works based on PHI and MOH officers are the main users here. Because during 
this corona crisis, we had to do a lot of work regarding this data because they were connected.
